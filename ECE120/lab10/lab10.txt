QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab10.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab10.bin.)

ANSWER: The program put decimal number 12 to R2 and store it. The register will modify R2 when it runs. Specificly, it will clear R2 first. Then it will add decimal number 12 in R2. When the program finishes, 12 will be contained in R2.


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: By using the "step" function, the programmer can easily see in which step they made a mistake. If there are multiple mistakes, they can see where they start messing up with the code. Then, they don't have to worry about the part that gave the correct outputs and only focus on the code afterward.
